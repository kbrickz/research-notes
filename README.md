# Security Research Notes

Public documentation of my security research learning journey. This repository serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others following a similar path.

## 📚 Purpose

This is my external brain for security research, containing:
- Study notes and command references
- Vulnerability research (generic, non-sensitive)
- Technique documentation and methodologies
- Learning reflections and progress tracking
- Tool usage guides and cheat sheets

## 🎯 Philosophy

**Building in public** - Documenting the learning process openly, including:
- What I don't understand (yet)
- Mistakes and how I fixed them
- Resources that helped
- Patterns and insights discovered

**Knowledge sharing** - Making security research more accessible by:
- Clear explanations of complex concepts
- Practical examples and demonstrations
- Honest assessment of difficulty
- Attribution to original sources

## 📝 Note Format

Notes follow a consistent structure:
- **Concept explanation** - What is it?
- **Why it matters** - Security relevance
- **How to use it** - Practical application
- **Examples** - Commands, code, scenarios
- **Resources** - Where to learn more

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These notes document authorized learning and research activities. Information is for educational purposes and authorized security testing only. Always obtain proper authorization before testing systems you don't own.
