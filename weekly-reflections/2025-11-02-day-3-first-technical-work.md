# Day 3: First Technical Work - TryHackMe and CS50 Problem Set 3

**Date:** November 02, 2025  
**Focus:** TryHackMe Introduction + CS50 Algorithms  
**Time:** ~5 hours  
**Status:** Complete

## TryHackMe: First Impressions

I started with TryHackMe's "Introduction to Cyber Security" room. The platform feels like a standard self-guided learning environment—somewhere between a college course and an interactive tutorial. It'll be seamless to work with going forward.

The intro content was quite easy, but I recognize the value. It provided a high-level overview of offensive security, defensive security, and career paths without diving into commands yet. More orientation than technical practice, which makes sense for a first room.

Key takeaway: TryHackMe's structure is clear. I know what to expect as I move into the Pre Security learning path.

## CS50 Problem Set 3: Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms Problem

The task was to identify which sorting algorithm (bubble, selection, merge) three compiled programs were using based on runtime analysis. Conceptually, this made sense—I understand why merge sort is O(n log n) and why bubble sort benefits from pre-sorted data.

But here's the thing: understanding the concept and being able to recreate or teach it are different skills. I could analyze the timing data with help, but I wouldn't be able to implement these algorithms from scratch yet. **Programming is hard.** I'm getting that more clearly now.

### Plurality Voting

This was more straightforward. The logic clicked: loop through candidates, find matches, increment votes, find maximum. I didn't get stuck much. 

What's becoming clear is that I'm good at understanding **what** needs to happen and **why**, but syntax memorization is not my strength. I keep forgetting which libraries to `#include`, when to use `strcmp` vs `==`, where semicolons and braces go. 

My mind is better suited to using code and math as **tools** rather than becoming a syntax expert. I'm terrible at memorization but good at understanding which concepts need to be applied where. This is fine—it's only CS50, and expectations for memorization are low. Syntax will improve with repetition. What matters more is learning to think through problems systematically.

### Runoff Voting

This was significantly harder. Much more complex logic: ranked preferences, multiple rounds, elimination, tie detection. I leaned heavily on AI to walk me through the structure. My syntax is poor enough that I need LLM assistance for anything beyond basic loops.

But I'm typing everything out myself rather than copy/pasting, and that's helping me internalize patterns. I understand the **concepts**—what `tabulate()` needs to do, why `is_tie()` works the way it does. The implementation syntax is what requires help.

I'm not intuitively understanding ~half of the programming problems immediately. It would be nice to get it without assistance. But the systems thinking and security concepts? Those click right away.

## What Excited Me

Starting to engage with actual security content, even at a high level, felt good. Knowing what's coming—web security, cloud exploitation, AI red teaming—is motivating. And knowing there are multiple backup career paths if things don't go exactly as planned is reassuring.

## Energy and Pace

The Intro TryHackMe room and CS50 Problem Set took about 5 hours total, spread over two days. I haven't been strictly time-boxing at 45 minutes. Instead, I sit down, get absorbed in the content, and work until I need a break or can't focus anymore. Then I walk away and come back. It's working for me, even if it's not following the exact structure I set for myself initially.

I'm a bit behind schedule (my stamina is poor), but I feel good about progress. The work is getting done. I'll catch up.

**Key Lessons:**
- Conceptual understanding ≠ implementation mastery (yet)
- Syntax memorization is not my strength; systematic thinking is
- LLM assistance is a tool, not a crutch—I'm still learning
- Security content is motivating; programming is a means to an end
- Natural energy management > rigid time-boxing (for me)
